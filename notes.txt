Various notes; it is Rolf's decision if they should make it into readme.md or elsewhere.

Load into eclipse

A possibility is

(1) check out git as normal (e.g. on command line)

(2) in eclipse: import --> Maven --> existing maven projects --> browse to location of local git repository --> import 

(3) missing hdf5 library: in eclipse: 
    right click on "silo" 
    --> Build Path 
    --> Configure Build Path 
    --> Source 
    --> silo/src/main/java 
    --> Native library location 
    --> Edit ... 
    --> add "silo/lib/macosx64" or whatever you need for your operating system
