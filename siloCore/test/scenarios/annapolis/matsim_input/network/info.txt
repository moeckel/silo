based on
"osm/md_and_surroundings.osm.bz2"
the following networks were created
01	osm-based matsim xml network with default
02	secondary/tertiary link with same settings as secondary/tertiary
03	thinner network; only down to tertiary
04	like 03, but with secondary/tertiary links included
05	like 04, but very thin; only very big roads kept (done by KN)

(other networks stored at shared-svn/projects/tum-with-moeckel/data/other/network)
